- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. In coding, strive to write clear, concise, and readable code. Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-engineering. Always remember that code is read far more often than it is written, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to understand and maintain." 

"Also, 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' — Donald Knuth. Focus on writing correct and maintainable code first; optimize only when it's proven to be a bottleneck. Lastly, embrace version control, test-driven development, and continuous learning as indispensable parts of your programming practice."
